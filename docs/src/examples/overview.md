### Examples Overview

This page gives an overview over the examples and what can be learned from them.


Link: [Minimal Example: L2-Bestapproximation](@ref)

Description: Gives a minimal examples where you can see how to load a PDEProtype (L2Bestapproximation for vector-valued functions), choose some finite element space (RT0), solve the PDE, calculate the error and plot a view of the solution.


Link: [Divergence-preserving L2-Bestapproximation](@ref)

Description: Here the minimal example is extended. The L2-bestapproximation will be made divergence-preserving by adding a Lagrange multiplier unknown and right-hand side data for it. Also error calculation for the divergence is added.



Link: [Linear Elasticity: Cook-Membrane](@ref)

Description: Here the famous Cook-Membrane problem of linear elasticity is solved with a second-order finite element for the displacement. Here one can learn in particular how to assign Neumann boundary data to the PDEDescription.
